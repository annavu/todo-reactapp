# ToDo ReactApp

with this app you can:
- add, edit, remove todos
- mark them as "complete"
- search through todos
- filter todos: all, complete, incomplete

App has some todos assigned by default, but it also uses localStorage so you can click and remove defaults and then use this app with your own todos.

Enjoy!
